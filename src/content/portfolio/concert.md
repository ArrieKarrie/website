Most musical artists are true performers in the sense that they create and perform passionately to share their love and enthusiasm for their craft, providing an unforgettable experience for those around them. Whenever I have the opportunity to experience these performances, I douse myself in the atmosphere and feel the energy of the crowds to find moments of which the artists didn't even know that they happened. I aspire to take photos that aren't simply snapshots of the event, but that tell the story of the act, bleed the character and raw emotion of the performance, and make the moments unforgettable for the artists as well.
