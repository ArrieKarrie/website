My background in engineering has given me a great appreciation for anything that has wheels and goes fast. Whether it might be a rather aesthetically pleasing solar car with state-of-the-art solar cells on top of it, or a more modest internal combustion engine powered vehicle, I love them all. Give me the opportunity to take some roller shots while hanging half outside of the passenger side of a driving car, and I'll gladly take it. If you are, or know, someone with a vehicle that is dear to them, don't hesitate to reach out!
