There is something special about photographing animals that even makes me, a true late-working night owl, want to wake up before sunrise just to catch a glimpse of them. At the start of my photography journey, I had the luxury of being able to photograph all kinds of animals during my visit in Australia, but even the most normal birds over here in The Netherlands can get me properly excited. It's fascinating to me how close you can get to these animals using a telephoto lens, a tool that allows you to take pictures that could look as if they were taken from not more than just a few metres away. It makes you see details on animals, often especially in their eyes, that you simply couldn't with just your own eyes.
