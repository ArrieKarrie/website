Similarly to my love for wildlife photography, I have a great appreciation for portrait photography. Not only because of the details that it allows you to see, especially in the eyes, but also because I find immeasurable value in the short social interactions that are to be had during these shoots. Many might find having their portrait taken to be something awkward, or even daunting, but I aspire to make it a fun and, most importantly, comfortable social experience, where the end product is a series of photos that truly reflect the little quirks and characteristics of that person in the moment.
