In 1999, a group of students from the Delft University of Technology decided to take up the challenge of building the fastest and most efficient car that runs solely on the energy of the sun, by driving 3000 km across the Australian outback while competing against other top universities. Two years later, they took home the trophy for first place, and ever since, the solar car student team project has been widely known as a great source of inspiration and innovation. "Nuna", as she is affectionately called, is the name of the solar car to which 12-18 students devote their time, effort, and frankly their whole life, for an entire year, with the mission of taking home the world championship and showing what can be achieved with renewables.

I myself had the unique opportunity to partake in this adventure in 2023, and this also sparked the beginning of my photography journey, as I got plenty of chances to take pictures of all kinds of subjects and environments. Currently, as an alumnus, I still like to keep in touch, for one because of the strong community around the project and my passion for engineering, but as a photographer there are also always plenty of invaluable moments waiting to be captured, which keeps me coming back.
