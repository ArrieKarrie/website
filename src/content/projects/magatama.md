Among the many student associations in Delft, Groover sets itself apart as one of the more unique and more recognisable ones with their music-forward jazz identity. They have a wide rotation of bands that play at various events throughout the city, one of which being Magatama; a 16-headed fusion band with all bits and bobs to create grander sounding versions of songs that you might already know. This occasion specifically was the last gig with this configuration, held at the cozy café Broeder Lazarus.
