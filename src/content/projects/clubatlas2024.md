When I got invited to take some pictures at the Club Atlas house party, I couldn't believe the things that I heard about its previous iterations; friends told me that it wasn't unusual for 200 to 300 people to show up, and that it would get so crowded and hot inside that sweat would condense on the walls, which is why the event could only ever be organised during winter. The location makes it even weirder, because, a few hundred people might not sound like much for an average party, until you see that the party is held in a historic house right in the middle of the city centre of Delft. In preparation for the party, the entire building is modified to house multiple stages where live music can be played by bands and DJs. These pictures were my attempts at capturing the experiences of the artists, until the smoke inside got so thick that you couldn't see a person standing right in front of you at 2 meters distance.
