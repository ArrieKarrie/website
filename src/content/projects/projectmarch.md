Project MARCH is one of many student teams in Delft, but they set themselves apart by working on a very noble goal: giving paraplegics their freedom back by designing and building a fully functional exoskeleton. Every year, a new group of roughly 25 students dedicates a full year away from their studies to the development and innovation for this project, and if there's no competition that year, all their work culminates in the Design Reveal, where a live demo will show the fruits of their efforts. These pictures were taken at the Design Reveal of MARCH X in the summer of 2025, which was held in the Grote Zaal at Tivoli Vredenburg in Utrecht.
