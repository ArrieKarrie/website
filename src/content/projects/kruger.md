It's not every day that you get to stand at arm's reach from a lion, yet this was the incredibly unique situation I found myself in when taking the cover photo of this album. In 2024, I travelled to South Africa as an alumnus of the Brunel Solar Team to help bring home another gold medal, but before going into the pressure cooker of that adventure, I took the opportunity to see a bit more of the country with a few of my dear friends. While visiting Kruger National Park, with the help of our amazing guide, we managed to spot all kinds of animals and we were treated to the most memorable views imaginable, which made it totally worthwhile that we had to set our alarms at 04:30 in the morning. These pictures might be the only reason why I still dream of saving up for a 600 mm telephoto lens, as it's simply unbelievable how close these lenses allow you to get to your subject. Looking at these pictures takes me right back to the feeling of driving around the savannah while constantly being on the lookout for anything that could be moving.
