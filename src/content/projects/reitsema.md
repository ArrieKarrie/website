To celebrate the 21 year anniversary of his company Reitsema + Partners, founder and head architect Theo Reitsema organised a party in the backyard of his statement piece living quarters in the foresty part of Rijssen, a small town in the eastern part of The Netherlands. The entire venue was cozily decorated with all kinds of colourful bits and bobs, and small incandescent lights, and at night, the trees lit up with the signature pink company colour. A large ring-shaped barbeque made sure that dinner became a proper fun social experience, and after sundown the area was transformed in a dance floor with live music from various energetic artists. Plenty of laughs and good conversations were shared while enjoying the delicious food and seemingly endless streams of beer and wine, and the night was closed off with music to which the partygoers could dance and sing to their hearts' content.
