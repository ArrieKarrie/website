Among students, it's not every day that you encounter someone who has an unreasonably effective knack for repairing old things, and it's even less likely that this person also has a love for vintage cars. Enter Ben, a dear friend of mine who used to spend his spare time working on vintage cars with friends on the weekend. Some years ago, he decided to buy an old Opel Manta, and it just so happened that his two other friends did the same. They restored these cars to their former glory up to the point that they could be comfortably used as daily drivers. To immortalise Ben with his Opel Manta, we took his car for a spin near the Veluwe and in the beautiful historic part of Vesting Naarden at night.
