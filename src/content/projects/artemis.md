Artemis, as they describe themselves, is a "hard rocking power trio from Delft with increasingly progressive tendencies". Consisting of Julius (guitar and vocals), Willem (bass) and Philip (drums), Artemis can be regularly heard and seen in various cafés and music venues throughout the country. I have followed them to more than a handful of events, and not one of their appearances has been dull or the same due to their energetic crowd interactions, often initiated by Julius, with Willem following closely at times.
