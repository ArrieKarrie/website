When I heard that there would be yet another iteration of the Club Atlas house party, I was immediately excited for the chance to have another go at capturing some truly unique pictures. The organisation did not disappoint with the setup, as the vinyl stage upstairs included a whopping 8 washing machines in stacks of 2 with LEDs inside, and the live stage created some almost ethereal lighting at times. While navigating through the rooms proved slightly more difficult this year, with some help from an empty closet or kitchen counter here and there I managed to get some cool angles above the crowd. The only thing that did not differ from last year, was the fact that at some point halfway through the morning, I simply could not take any pictures anymore as sightlines were severely limited to roughly 2 meters in the thick smoke. Fortunately, there had been plenty of opportunities before that to take some stylish pictures.
